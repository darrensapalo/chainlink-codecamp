# Certification

# Morning session

Congratulations to all the attendees!

You completed the morning session of the Chainlink Codecamp, which involved:

- Configuring and funding your testnet wallets
- Learning about Chainlink and Verifiable Random Functions
- Writing your own Chainlink VRF consumer and interacting with the chainlink coordinators
- Learning to use OpenZeppelin to create a customized smart contract
- Learning to use Remix IDE to compile and deploy smart contracts
- Writing a smart contract that generates a random dog as its image on OpenSea

The above details can be further explored [here](https://github.com/QingyangKong/Chainlink-bootcamp-day1).

At the end of the session, you should have successfully deployed your smart contract (NFTDogs.sol)
on the Mumbai test network, and have the address of that smart contract. You can share this on the padlet
to show proof of your work.

# Afternoon session

In the afternoon session, Frank covered the following topics and concepts:

- Discussing the opportunity for dynamic NFTs
- How you can use Chainlink's decentralized oracle network to fetch real world data
- How we can possibly use external data (e.g. temperature) to create dynamic NFTs

The above details can be further explored [here](https://github.com/QingyangKong/Chainlink-bootcamp-day2).

# Receiving a certificate

To receive the silver or gold certificates, you need to message @darrensapalo on Telegram
or email me at darren.sapalo@gmail.com with subject "Chainlink Codecamp Certificate".

I will then coordinate with Frank with regard to transferring the certificates.

⚠ Reminder: For security purposes, please do not use an ETH wallet account that is associated to your dev/test network! You were supposed to use a throwaway wallet address during the session as stated in the setup instructions (step 1.3).

## Silver certificate

The silver certificate signifies that you've completed the work in the morning session.

To receive the certificate, you must:

1. Provide the smart contract address (the NFTDogs.sol that you've deployed) demonstrating that you have successfully completed the work.
2. Provide the ETH wallet address where the certificate will be sent.
3. Provide your LinkedIn URL.

## Gold certificate

The silver certificate signifies that you've completed the work in the morning session.

To receive the certificate, you must:
