# Certification

# Morning session

Congratulations to all the attendees!

You completed the morning session of the Chainlink Codecamp, which involved:

- Configuring and funding your testnet wallets
- Learning about Chainlink and Verifiable Random Functions
- Writing your own Chainlink VRF consumer and interacting with the chainlink coordinators
- Learning to use OpenZeppelin to create a customized smart contract
- Learning to use Remix IDE to compile and deploy smart contracts
- Writing a smart contract that generates a random dog as its image on OpenSea

The above details can be further explored [here](https://github.com/QingyangKong/Chainlink-bootcamp-day1).

At the end of the session, you should have successfully deployed your smart contract (NFTDogs.sol)
on the Mumbai test network, and have the address of that smart contract. You can share this on the padlet
to show proof of your work.

# Afternoon session

In the afternoon session, Frank covered the following topics and concepts:

- Discussing the opportunity for dynamic NFTs
- How you can use Chainlink's decentralized oracle network to fetch real world data
- How we can possibly use external data (e.g. temperature) to create dynamic NFTs

The above details can be further explored [here](https://github.com/QingyangKong/Chainlink-bootcamp-day2).
